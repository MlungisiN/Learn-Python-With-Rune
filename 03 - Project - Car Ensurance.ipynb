    "- This is a fictional car insurance company called Car Crash\n",
    "- They calculate the yearly ensurance price based on the current market price of the car\n",
    "- Given the market price: market_price\n",
    "- Then the yearly ensurance price is 9% of the market_price if it is a male above 26 years old.\n",
    "- As we see in the decision tree, we have 4 possible price calculations.\n",
    "- Create a program, which takes input and based on that calculated the correct price for all 4 cases"
